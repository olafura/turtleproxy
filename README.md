TurtleProxy simulates slow connections
======================================

Currently TurtleProxy supports mobile connections as listed in --help

You can also assign your own speed and latency.

Run
---

It's written in Go so you need to do:

`go get`

`go install`

Instead of installing it you can also do:

`go run turtleproxy.go`

Future
------
* Provide regular binary releases
* Add support for speed and latency ranges
* Add other connections to simulate
* Possible introduce package loss
