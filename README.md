TurtleProxy simulates slow connections
======================================

Currently TurtleProxy supports mobile connections as listed in --help
You can also assign your own speed and latency.

It's written in Go so you need to do::
go get
go install

Instead of installing it you can also do::
go run turtleproxy.go

Future
------
* Provide regular binary releases
* Add support for speed and latency ranges
* Add other connections to simulate
* Possible introduce package loss
